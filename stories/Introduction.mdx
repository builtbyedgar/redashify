## Features

Dashup provides a simple and versatile solution for building interactive dashboards in your **React** applications. With its intuitive API and extensive customization options, you can create dynamic and visually dope dashboards in no time.

Whether you need draggable and resizable widgets for flexible layout arrangements, fixed widgets, or a serialized layout for saving and loading dashboard configurations, this component library has you covered.

#### ⚛️ 100% React & TypeScript

The components are built using [React v18](https://github.com/facebook/react/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), ensuring type safety and a seamless integration with your existing projects.

#### 🍿 Zero dependencies

The library has no external dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to manage.

#### 🎛️ Draggable and resizable widgets

Intuitively drag and rearrange widgets within the dashboard to suit your needs. Resize widgets to optimize the layout and maximize content visibility.

#### ⏸️ Fixes widgets

Create widgets that can't be resized or moved, not even by other widgets!

#### 🗂️ Serialized layout

Save and load the dashboard layout effortlessly using a serialized format.

#### 🎨 Fully customizable

Customize the appearance, behavior, and styling of the components to match your application's branding and requirements.

#### 🔋 High performance

Using the best practices for React performance optimization, the library ensures smooth rendering and fluid user experiences.

### Dashboard component

The `<Dashboard />` component exposes a simple but effective API:

  widgets: Layout
  /** number of columns */
  columns?: number
  /** the rows height */
  rowHeight?: number
  /** the margin between widgets */
  margin?: [number, number]
  /** packing the layout */
  packing?: boolean
  /** the className for the placeholder (ghost) */
  placeholderClassName?: string
  /** callback method when a widget is moved, resized or deleted */
  onChange?: (widgets: Layout) => void
  /** callback method when the dashboard (or window) is resized */
  onResize?: () => void
}
```

```tsx
const widget: WidgetProps = {
  id: uuidv4(),
  x: 0,
  y: 2,
  width: 3,
  height: 2,
  title: 'Widget 1',
  draggable: true,
  removible: true,
  stationary: false,
  component: <ComponentForWidget />,
}

const widgets: Layout = [widget, ...]

<Dashboard
  widgets={widgets}
  columns={12}
  rowHeight={100}
  onChange={handleDashboardChange}
/>
```

#### Widget props

  id: string
  /** In columns */
  x: number
  /** In rows */
  y: number
  /** In columns */
  width: number
  /** In rows */
  height: number
  /** In columns */
  minWidth?: number
  /** In rows */
  minHeight?: number
  maxWidth?: number
  maxHeight?: number
  /** make widget fixed */
  fixed?: boolean
  /** make widget draggable */
  draggable?: boolean
  /** make widget resizable */
  resizable?: boolean
  /** the widget title */
  title: string
  /** the component that will be rendered into the widget */
  component?: JSX.Element
